# LeagueChatter
Script that allow sending chat messages in league of legends with a gui on screen
Require autohotkey to run the script. Autohotkey is a very very small software that is very safe and quick to install and allow quick automation among other things.

The tool only work if you are in a league of legends game

Use Numpad1 to show and hide the gui.

Use either the Gui buttons or the arrow keys left and right to change the selected message.

Use Numpad2 to send the message to the game. Works regardless of gui being shown or not.

If, for whatever reason you need to quickly terminate the script, press f4.


I am not responsible for ban that might occur, but i have been using autohotkey together with league of legends on NA server for 4 seasons without issues.
