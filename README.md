Script that allow sending chat messages in league of legends with a gui on screen Require autohotkey to run the script. Autohotkey is a very very small software that is very safe and quick to install and allow quick automation among other things. https://www.autohotkey.com/

The tool only work if you are in a league of legends game.



Use either the Gui buttons or the arrow keys left and right to change the selected messages pages.



Hotkeys:
-Numpad0: show and hide the gui.
-Numpad1-9: send the message to the game. Works regardless of gui being shown or not.
-Numpad*: cycle through the gui themes

Guide:
-Use a spreadsheet editor (or a text editor if you cannot use excel or libre office or whatever) to edit messages.csv, which contain all the messages you want to be able to send
-Edit the .ini file to change settings for the tool or use the configurator tool. 
The settings should be self explanatory.

If, for whatever reason you need to quickly terminate the script, press ctrl+f4.
